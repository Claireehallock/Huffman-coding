# Huffman-coding
First compile, then
To run the Main use: java Main.java sourceFile compressedFile targetFile

#### Where:
sourceFile is a file that contains the source information
compressedFile is the file that will contain the compressed version of sourceFile
targetFile is the file that will be created by decoding compressedFile

## Notes
This was done as a project with certain guidelines, so Main.java, Compress_a_File.java, and Decompress_a_File.java exist to more easily demostrate that to code works. The important files include: EncodingTreeNode.java, Decompress.java, and Compress.java.

If someone wanted to compress and decompress separately, they would need to use a different Main function
